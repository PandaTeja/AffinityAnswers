How much of Unix command line are you familiar with? Give some examples.
ls - lists your files
ls -l - lists your files in 'long format', which contains lots of useful information, 
ls -a - lists all files, including the ones whose filenames begin in a dot, which you do not always want to see.
mkdir dirname - make a new directory
cd dirname - change directory.
more filename - shows the first part of a file, just as much as will fit on one screen. Just hit the space bar to see more or q to quit. You can use /pattern to search for a pattern.
emacs filename - is an editor that lets you create and edit a file. See the emacs page.
mv filename1 filename2 -moves a file (i.e. gives it a different name, or moves it into a different directory (see below)
cp filename1 filename2 -copies a file
rm filename - removes a file.
